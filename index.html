    <p><i>Bonjour</i>. Here are some of the things I've written. Many are incomplete, which you may take as an invitation to finish the story however you like, and many are errant, which you may take as a sign of my fallibility. Very little here has been proof-read. Don't take anything said here on faith; verify its correctness for yourself!</p>
